        <h1>Recover From Addiction, Regain Your Life</h1>
        <p>
          Addiction isn't weakness — it's a powerful cycle that rewires our brain and controls our behavior.
          Whether it's digital, chemical, or emotional, Relief is designed to help you regain control with
          clarity, support, and consistency.
